# GPmp: the Gaussian process micro package

## Features

GPmp intends to provide building blocks for GP-based algorithms.
It should be fast and easily customizable. It uses auto-differentiation
and JIT compilation features provided by [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/).

GPmp implements :
* GP interpolation and regression with unknown mean / intrinsinc kriging
* The standard Gaussian likelihood and the restricted likelihood of a model
* Leave-one-out predictions using fast cross-validation formulas
* Conditional sample paths

It is up to the user to write the mean and covariance functions for
setting a GP model. However, GPmp provides building blocks for:
* anisotropic scaling
* distance matrix
* Mat√©rn kernels with half-integer regularities
* Parameter selection using maximum likelihood, restricted maximum
  likelihood, or user-defined criteria

Note also that for the purpose of simplicity, the gpmp does not
check the validity of arguments. This is left to the responsibility
of the user / calling code.

## Installation

Clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/gpmp-dev/gpmp.git
```
(or download a zip version)

Install in dev mode:
```
pip install -e .
```

Remarks:

1. GPmp is based on JAX, which requires jaxlib, and which is
   supported on Linux and macOS platforms, and on Windows via the
   Windows Subsystem for Linux. There is some initial native Windows
   support, but it is still somewhat immature (see below).

2. To install JAX with both CPU and NVidia GPU support, CUDA and CuDNN
   must be installed first. See
   https://github.com/google/jax#installation and
   https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html for details.

   For instance, to install jaxlib  with Cuda 11 and cudnn 8.2 or newer:
```bash   
pip install jax[cuda11_cudnn82] -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
```
   
3. To install jaxlib on Windows, one can follow instructions at
   https://github.com/cloudhan/jax-windows-builder.  Select and
   download a version of jaxlib from
   https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html according to
   your Python version. Then install jax manually.

```powershell
pip install <jaxlib_whl>
pip install jax
```

## Usage

Please refer to the examples that illustrate the different features of GPmp.

## Documentation with Sphinx
The automatic documentation is created using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and following the python docstrings recommendations from [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)

The html theme is taken from
>pip install pydata_sphinx_theme

In order to generate the intereactive html:
>cd ./docs

>make html

## To do

* unit tests
* improve package setup
