GPmp documentation
========================

Welcome to the GPmp API: the Gaussian process micro package.

GPmp intends to provide building blocks for GP-based algorithms. It uses auto-differentiation and JIT compilation features provided by `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`_. It should be fast and easily
customizable.

For the purpose of simplicity, the gpmp does not check the validity of arguments. This is left to the responsibility of the user / calling
code.

Implemented Methods
===================

*   GP interpolation and regression with unknown mean / intrisinc kriging

*   The standard Gaussian likelihood and the restricted likelihood of a model

*   Leave-one-out predictions using fast cross-validation formulas

*   Conditional sample paths

It is up to the user to write the mean and covariance functions for setting a GP model. However, GPmp provides building blocks for:

*   Anisotropic scaling

*   Distance matrix

*   Mat√©rn kernels with half-integers regularties

*   Parameter selection using maximum likelihood / restricted maximum likelihood / or user-defined criteria
